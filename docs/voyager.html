    <h2>How do I discover opportunities and enlighten others?</h2>
      <p>As a voyager you have stakes that matter. Whether you were to
    invest on a ValOS collaborator as a financier, to adopt ValOS as
    technology as an executive or just to commit your personal time and
    energy on a ValOS project you need to <em>see</em> forward.</p>
      <p>To make sound decisions and to position yourself proactively you
    need to understand the big picture and philosophy of the ValOS
    ecosystem. Only then you can enlighten others.</p>
      <p>You use tailored but real-world ValOS demo setups to illustrate
    how ValOS a solution could be configured to meet the needs at hand.
    Your audience can be your customer, your team or even just
    yourself.</p>
