    <h2>VPath with a vgrid is a resource identifier: a VRId</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>VPaths serve two notably different purposes, both as paths and as
resource identifiers. A VPath which has a global valospace resource
identifier (or &#x27;vgrid&#x27;) as its first segment is a valospace resource
identifier (or *VRId*).</p>
      <p><pre><code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">  vpath         = &#x22;@&#x22; vgrid-tail / verbs-tail
  vgrid-tail    = vgrid &#x22;@&#x22; [ verbs-tail ]
  verbs-tail     = verb &#x22;@&#x22; [ verbs-tail ]
  verb          = verb-type params
</span>
</code></pre></p>
      <p>Many valospace resources, so called *structural sub-resources* are
identified by a fixed path from the global resource defined by the same
verbs that define non-VRId VPaths. Thus while paths and identifiers are
superficially different it is useful to represent them both using the
same VPath verb structure.</p>
      <p>Both verb and vgrid params can also have context term references to
an external lookup of URI prefixes and semantic definitions.</p>

  <section id="section_equivalence" class="vdoc type-vdoc-chapter">
    <h2>VPath equivalence follows URN equivalence</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Two VPaths identify the same path and in case they&#x27;re VRIds, refer to
the same resource iff their URN representations are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141#section-3" class="vdoc type-vdoc-reference">urn-equivalent</a>. In other words two VPath are equivalent if and only if they are
lexically equivalent after case normalization of any percent-encoded
characters.</p>
      <p>For the general case the actual semantics of a VPath and specifically
of its context-term&#x27;s depends on the context it is used. Vrids have a
fixed context which is established by the vgrid. This has some
implications:<a href="https://valospace.org/raem/VPath#section_vrid_equivalence" class="vdoc type-vdoc-reference">read more about the VRId equivalence</a>.</p>

  <section id="section_verb" class="vdoc type-vdoc-chapter">
    <h2>*verb* - a step from a source resource to target resource(s)</h2>
A verb is a one-to-maybe-many relationship between resources. A verb
can be as simple as a trivial predicate of atriple or it can represent
something as complex as a fully parameterized computation or a function
call.

A verb is made up of type and a parameter list, with each parameter
carrying an optional context-term in addition to their value.
<pre><code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">  verbs-tail     = verb &#x22;@&#x22; [ verbs-tail ]
  verb          = verb-type params
  verb-type     = 1*unencoded

  params        = context-tail / value-tail
  context-tail  = &#x22;$&#x22; [ context-term ] [ &#x22;:&#x22; param-value [ params ] / context-tail ]
  value-tail    = &#x22;:&#x22; param-value [ params ]

  context-term  = ALPHA *unreserved-nt
  param-value   = vpath / 1*( unencoded / pct-encoded )
</span>
</code></pre>

Note that while the grammar of verb-type and context-term are
still relatively restricted, *param-value* both allows for fully
unencoded nesting of vpath&#x27;s as well as allows encoding of all unicode
characters in percent encoded form (as per encodeURIComponent).

  <section id="section_verb_context_term" class="vdoc type-vdoc-chapter">
    <h2> &#x27;context-term&#x27; is a lookup to definitions provided by the context</h2>

A verb (and vgrid via its format-term) can be contextual via the
context-term&#x27;s of its params. The context where the verb is used
defines the exact meaning of these terms. The meaning for context-terms
is recommended to be uniform across domains where possible. A verb is
invalid in contexts which don&#x27;t have a definition for its context-term.
This gives different contexts a fine-grained mechanism for defining the
vocabularies that are available.

Idiomatic example of such context is the event log and its JSON-LD
context structure which is to define both URI namespace prefixes as
well as available semantics.
  </section>

  <section id="section_param_value" class="vdoc type-vdoc-chapter">
    <h2>&#x27;param-value&#x27; specifies vgrid and verb payload</h2>

*params* is a sequence of param-value&#x27;s, optionally prefixed with
&#x22;$&#x22; and a context-term. The idiomatic param-value is a string. If
present a context-term usually denotes a URI prefix in which case the
param-value is a URI reference. However contexts are free to provide
specific semantics for specific context-terms, such as interpreting
them as the value type of the param-value etc.

    <h2>VRId is a stable identifier of a global resource or a structural sub-resource</h2>
A VRId is a vpath which has vgrid as its first production (via

The VRId can be directly used as the NSS part of an &#x27;urn:valos:&#x27;
prefixed URI.

Each valospace resource is identified by a VRId.

If a resource VRId has only vgrid part but no verbs the resource is
called a global resource.

If a resource VRId has verbs then the verbs describe a structural path
from the global resource of its initial vgrid part to the resource
itself. The resource is called a *structural sub-resource* of that
global resource.

Each resource is affiliated with an event log of its global resource.

All direct VRId context-terms are references to this event log <a href="https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#the-context" class="vdoc type-vdoc-reference">JSON-LD context</a>.

    <h2>VRId is affiliated with an event log</h2>

      <p>The resource identified by a VRId is always affiliated with an event

locator information of this event log it must be discoverable from the

      <p>More complex equivalences are outside the scope of this document but

  <section id="section_structural_sub_resources" class="vdoc type-vdoc-chapter">
    <h2>VRId verbs identify structural sub-resources - fixed ownership, inferred state, &#x27;secondary keys&#x27;</h2>
In VRId context the verbs-tail that follows the VGRId specifies
a structural path from the global resource to a
*structural sub-resource* of the global resource. The triple
constraints of each verb in that path are _inferred as triples_ for the
particular resource that that verb affects.

<blockquote>Principle: a structured sub-resource using a particular
verbs-tail in its identifying VRId will always infer the triples that
are required to satisfy the same verbs-tail in a query context which
starts from the same global resource.</blockquote>

This fixed triple inference is the meat and bones of the structural
sub-resources: they allow for protected, constrained semantics to be
expressed in the valospace resources. This allows both simplified
semantics (eg. properties _cannot_ be renamed so the complex
functionality doesn&#x27;t need to be supported on fabric level), more
principled mechanism for partition crypto behaviours (permission
relations are structural sub-resources which simplifies security
analysis but retains valospace convenience) and also a mechanism for
expressing non-trivial resources such as hypertwin resources.

The sub-resources can be nested and form a tree with the global
resource as the root. Typical verb sub-segments specify the edges in
this tree (some verbs only specify the current node resource further
without specifying a new edge). The global resource is the host
resource for the first verb; the sub-resource of that segment is the
host resource of the second verb and so on.

As the VRId identities of the sub-resources are structurally fixed to
this tree the coupling between host and sub-resource must be static.
The typical implementation for this is an ownership coupling.

This means that no matter where a subspace variant is defined in
the prototype chain or in the nested sub-structure its value will be
found.</p>
      <p>e.g. &#x60;&#x3C;urn:valos:@$iu4:f00b@.:myProp@_$lang:fi@&#x3E;&#x60; is a lang fi
variant of f00b myProp and infers triples:
<pre><code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">

</code></pre></p>
      <p>Subspace selectors can be used to access language variants,
statically identified ghost variants within an instance, statically
identified Relation&#x27;s etc.</p>
      <p>The verb segment-term can also specify triple inferences for *all*
sub-resources in the subspace (not just for the immediate
sub-resource of the selector segment).</p>

    <h2>Collected VPath ABNF grammar</h2>
The VPath grammar is an LL(1) grammar. It is recursive as param-value
productions can contain nested vpaths without additional encoding.

The list of definitive rules:
<pre><code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">  vpath         = &#x22;@&#x22; vgrid-tail / verbs-tail

  vgrid-tail    = vgrid &#x22;@&#x22; [ verbs-tail ]

  verbs-tail     = verb &#x22;@&#x22; [ verbs-tail ]
  verb          = verb-type params
  verb-type     = 1*unencoded

  pct-encoded   = &#x22;%&#x22; HEXDIG HEXDIG</span>
</code></pre>

In addition there are pseudo-rules which are not used by an LL(1)
parser but which have well-defined meaning and can thus be referred to
from other documents.

The list of informative pseudo-rules:
<pre><code><span class="vdoc type-vdoc-node">  vrid            = &#x22;@&#x22; vgrid-tail
  verbs          = &#x22;@&#x22; verbs-tail
  vparam          = [ &#x22;$&#x22; [ context-term ] ] [ &#x22;:&#x22; param-value ]
  context-term-ns = ALPHA 0*30unreserved-nt ( ALPHA / DIGIT )
</span>
</code></pre>

There are couple notes not explicitly expressed by the the grammar
itself. These notes primarily relate to LL(1)-parseability:
    <ul>
      <li>Pseudo-rule &#x27;vrid&#x27;: this class contains all &#x27;vpath&#x27; productions with
  &#x27;vgrid&#x27; as their first expansion.</li>
      <li>Pseudo-rule &#x27;vparam&#x27;: this class contains all &#x27;context-tail&#x27; and
  &#x27;value-tail&#x27; expansions while excluding their &#x27;[ params ]&#x27; and
  &#x27;context-tail&#x27; right recursive expansions.</li>
      <li>Also note how &#x27;params&#x27; rule is right recursive. This is to ensure
  that the string &#x22;$foo:bar&#x22; will be properly LL(1)-parsed as a
  singular &#x27;context-tail&#x27; with &#x27;param-value&#x27;, instead of a
  &#x27;context-tail&#x27; (without &#x27;param-value&#x27;) that is followed by
  &#x27;value-tail&#x27;.
  To represent a &#x27;context-tail&#x27; (without &#x27;param-value&#x27;) that is
  followed by a &#x27;value-tail&#x27; an empty context must be added:
  &#x22;$foo$:bar&#x22;. To represent an empty param an empty &#x22;$&#x22; can be
  inserted: &#x22;$$foo:bar&#x22; and as a consequence if the following param of
  an empty param has no context it must also prepended with &#x22;$&#x22; like
  so: &#x22;$$:bar&#x22;.</li>
      <li>Pseudo-rule &#x27;context-term-ns&#x27;: this class contains all &#x27;context-term&#x27;
  expansions which match this more restrictive specification (max 32
  chars, special chars only in the middle). All &#x27;context-term&#x27;s which
  are plain namespace prefixes should be restricted to this rule as
  this is the prefix grammar of some relevant prefix context.
  <blockquote>Editorial Note: which context was this again? Neither
    SPARQL, Turtle nor JSON-LD have this limitation.</blockquote></li>
      <li>The nesting hierarchy can be manually quickly established by first
  splitting a valid vpath string by the delimiter regex /(@$:)/
  (retaining these delimiters in the result). Then a tree structure is
  formed by traversing the array from left to right and dividing it to
  different nesting depths. The nesting depth is increased for the
  initial &#x22;@&#x22; and for each &#x22;@&#x22; that is preceded by a &#x22;:&#x22; (corresponds
  to the &#x27;vpath&#x27; production prefix of some &#x27;short-param&#x27; production)
  and reducing the nesting depth for each &#x22;@&#x22; that is succeeded by a
  &#x22;$&#x22;, &#x22;:&#x22;, &#x22;@&#x22; or EOF (corresponds to the terminator of the last
  &#x27;vgrid&#x27; or &#x27;verb&#x27; production of some &#x27;vpath&#x27; production). All
  remaining &#x22;@&#x22; correspond to non-final &#x27;vgrid&#x27; or &#x27;verb&#x27; production
  terminators of some &#x27;vpath&#x27; rule production and thus don&#x27;t change the
  nesting depth.</li>

maintain direct drop-in 2141 compatibility would require disallowing
&#x22;~&#x22; from the character set. This in turn would complicate specific
javascript domain implementations as they would have to encode &#x22;~&#x22;
separately without being able to solely rely on encodeURIComponent.</p>
      <p>As this concern is not likely to be a problem in practice anyway we
