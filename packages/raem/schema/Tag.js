        `The tag URI as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4151. Tags never form a part
of the content id. This allows tag URI schemas to refer to the same Tag separately or internally
using different sub-schemas. The tag URI must be complete against the GraphQL schema that defines
it so that a fully expanded GraphQL Tag data object can be created from the URI.
Valaa schema tags are of the form tag://valaa.com,2017:dataType(:subType)/content where
dataType is the particular Tag data type string (such as Literal or Identifier) subType is an
additional optional qualifier for the dataType and content is in a format determined by the data
type. Valaa schema does not allow for sub-schemas and thus two valaa tags are the same if and only
if they compare the same as per RFC (have same machine representation, ie. equal by typical string
comparison).`
