`The dominant type class of 'unsourced' valospace resources. An
unsourced resource doesn't have a known representation in this view of
the world, typically because it is inside an unsourced Partition.
The transition from Unsourced to and from other dominant types is the
only possible runtime type change and happens dynamically based on
the partition sourcery and banishment.`,
