Infrastructure code which\nchanges rarily can be placed under tool packages with naive\ndeployment logic which relies on the tool package version number only.\nFrequently changing configs can be managed by the toolset workspace\nitself but even it can then use tool workspaces to source in\ncommands and other resources to help with the deployment management.\n\nAdditionally because the tool configuration is always inside its\nparent toolset config this allows the same tool be used by several\ndifferent toolsets in a single workspace.
