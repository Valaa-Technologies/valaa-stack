A tool differs from a toolset in that it cannot be\nstandalone; it doesn't appear in listings, its always part of one or\nmore toolsets and its toolsets.json config stanzas are placed under\nits parent toolset stanzas.\n\nThe main case for tools and toolsets separation came from the release\ndeployment system of opspaces, where the modularity and granular\nsemantic versioning of tool packages allows for more efficient and\nrobust deployments.\n\nTool workspaces allows splitting complex toolsets into separate\ntools with different deployment logic. Infrastructure code which\nchanges rarily can be placed under tool packages with naive\ndeployment logic which relies on the tool package version number only.\nFrequently changing configs can be managed by the toolset workspace\nitself but even it can then use tool workspaces to source in\ncommands and other resources to help with the deployment management.\n\nAdditionally because the tool configuration is always inside its\nparent toolset config this allows the same tool be used by several\ndifferent toolsets in a single workspace. Because of this all tool\ncommands must have an option for '--toolset=<@scope/toolsetname>' which\nuses yargs.vlm.toolset as its default value."

Vaults are used to group packages with high cohesion\ntogether so that development, testing, review and deployment workflows\ncan be done within a single repository when feasible.\n\nVault is primarily an organizational unit and is hosted in a single\nversion control repository. All sub-workspaces have identical access\nrights for all contributors. All sub-workspaces must have similar\nlicences. Exceptions to this must be clearly noted both in the\nexceptional workspace root document as well as in the vault root\ndocument.\n\nA vault can have different types of domains in it; some of these\n(such as libraries, toolsets) may be published to repositories as\n*packages* so that they can be used as dependencies for other\nworkspaces. Others are only local and used for other purposes;\n*opspaces* contain configurations and tools for managing infrastructure\nconfigurations and *workers* contain files for spawning local processes.\n\nNo matter what the valos type of the domain all share important\nqualities: they can have package dependencies, are versioned and are\nmanaged by valma.\n\nA vault often also manages a *domain* for the packages it publishes via\na *domain domain package*. Domain is a discovery construct. When\na domain domain is added as a devDependency to some external package\nthen valma will be able to list and configure any applicable toolsets\nand other domains for this package.\n"
